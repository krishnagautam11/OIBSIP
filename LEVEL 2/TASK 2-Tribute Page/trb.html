        <ul>
          <li><strong>1942:</strong> Born Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr., on Jan. 17, in Louisville, Ky.</li><br>
          <li><strong>1954:</strong> Clay starts training with boxing coach Fred Stoner.
            <br><br>
            Over the next six years, Clay would win six Kentucky Golden Gloves championships, two national Golden Gloves
            titles, and two AAU (Amateur Athletic Union) crowns.
          </li><br>

          <li><strong>1960:</strong> Clay wins the light-heavyweight gold medal at the Summer Olympics in Rome.
            <br><br>
            Upon returning to Louisville, Clay is refused service by a waitress at a "whites-only" restaurant. Disgusted
            of this racism, he throws his gold medal into the Ohio River.
          </li><br>

          <li><strong>1964</strong> Clay defeats the heavily favored Sonny Liston to become heavyweight champion of the
            world.
            <br><br>
            After the fight, Clay announces he has become a Black Muslim and has changed his name to Muhammad Ali.
          </li><br>

          <li><strong>1967</strong> Ali refuses induction into the U.S. Army due to his religious convictions. He angers
            many Americans after claiming, "I ain't got no quarrel with those Vietcong." He is subsequently stripped of
            his WBA title and his license to fight.
            <br><br>
            In June, a court finds him guilty of draft evasion, fines him $10,000, and sentences him to five years in
            prison. He remains free, pending numerous appeals, but is still barred from fighting.
          </li><br>
          <li><strong>1970</strong> Due to a loophole (there was no state boxing commission in Georgia), Ali returns to
            the ring in Atlanta and knocks out Jerry Quarry in three rounds.</li> <br>
          <li><strong>1971</strong> In March, he fights heavyweight champ Joe Frazier in Madison Square Garden. A left
            hook by Frazier knocks Ali down in the 15th round. Frazier wins by unanimous decision.
            <br><br>
            Three months later, the Supreme Court rules in his favor, reversing the 1967 draft-evasion conviction.
          </li><br>
          <li><strong>1974</strong> In January, he gains a measure of revenge from Frazier, besting the former champ in
            12 rounds.
            <br><br>
            Regains the heavyweight title in the "Rumble in the Jungle" on Oct. 30 in Kinshasa, Zaire after knocking out
            champion George Foreman in the eighth round. He successfully uses his "rope-a-dope" strategy—Ali allowed
            Foreman to get him against the ropes and swing away until he tired himself out. Then Ali attacked.
          </li><br>
          <li><strong>1975</strong> Ali fights Frazier for the third time at the "Thrilla in Manila" in the Philippines.
            The two heavyweights batter and bloody each other in a ferocious battle, but Ali retains his belt when
            Frazier can't come out for the 15th round. <br><br> Ali converted from the Nation of Islam to mainstream
            Sunni Islam this year, under the influence of Wallace Dean Muhammad, the son of Elijah Muhammmad.
          </li><br>
          <li><strong>1978</strong> With a career record of 55–2, an overconfident Ali loses his belt to 1976 Olympic
            champ Leon Spinks in a 15-round split decision. Spinks' reign as champ is brief, however, as Ali wins back
            the title in a unanimous decision seven months later to become the first (and still only) fighter to win the
            world title three times.</li><br>
          <li><strong>1979</strong> Announces his retirement on June 27.</li><br>
          <li><strong>1980</strong> Comes out of retirement to fight new heavyweight champ Larry Holmes. Holmes punishes
            Ali, landing an estimated 125 punches in the ninth and tenth rounds alone, and then knocks him out in the
            11th.
            <br><br>
            Ali convinces the Kenyan government to boycott the Moscow Olympics as a response to the Soviet invasion of
            Afghanistan.
          </li><br>
          <li><strong>1981</strong> Loses a unanimous decision to Trevor Berbick, and finally hangs up the gloves for
            good, retiring with an overall professional record of 56—5.
            <br><br>
            On January 19, in Los Angeles, Ali talked a suicidal man down from jumping off a ninth-floor ledge, an event
            that made national news.
          </li><br>
          <li><strong>1984</strong> Ali is diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, a neurological disorder whose symptoms
            include muscle tremors and slowness of speech.</li><br>
          <li><strong>1990</strong> Ali travels to Iraq to successfully negotiate the release of 15 American hostages
            with Saddam Hussein</li><br>
          <li><strong>1996</strong> Ali carries the Olympic torch and ignites the cauldron to signal the beginning of
            the Summer Olympics in Atlanta. He is also given a second gold medal, to replace the one he tossed in the
            river 36 years earlier.
            <br><br>
            When We Were Kings, a documentary about the Rumble in the Jungle, won an Academy Award.
          </li><br>
          <li><strong>2001</strong> On January 8th, Ali is awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal by Bill Clinton.
            <br><br>
            The biopic Ali, starring Will Smith as Ali, is nominated for an Oscar.
          </li><br>
          <li><strong>2005</strong> He is awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by George W. Bush, the highest U.S.
            civilian honor.
            <br><br>
            On November 19, 2005, the $60 million non-profit Muhammad Ali Center opened in downtown Louisville. In
            addition to displaying his boxing memorabilia, the center focuses on core themes of peace, social
            responsibility, respect, and personal growth.
          </li><br>

          <li><strong>2016</strong>
            Muhammad Ali died on June 3, 2016 as the result of septic shock due to unspecified natural causes. He was 74
            years old.
            <br><br>
            He was buried in Louisville, Kentucky. He planned his own funeral which included eulogies from former
            President Bill Clinton, sportscaster Bryant Gumbel and comedian and close friend Billy Crystal.
            <br><br>
            The services began on June 9, 2016, with an Islamic Janazah prayer service at Freedom Hall on the grounds of
            the Kentucky Exposition Center. A funeral procession went through the streets of Louisville on June 10,
            2016, ending at Cave Hill Cemetery, where a private interment ceremony occurred. Ali's grave is marked with
            a simple granite marker that bears only his name. A public memorial service for Ali at downtown Louisville's
            KFC Yum! Center was held in the afternoon of June 10. The pallbearers included Will Smith, Lennox Lewis and
            Mike Tyson, with honorary pallbearers including George Chuvalo, Larry Holmes and George Foreman.
            <br><br>
            Ali leaves behind his (fourth) wife, Lonnie, seven daughters, his biological son and his adopted son.
